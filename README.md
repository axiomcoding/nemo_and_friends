# Nemo and Friends
Time to create object classes for the Finding Nemo characters. Crush, Nemo, and Dory are defined by separate classes and are in their own Ruby files with their own RSpec files.  

When the `rspec` command is run, it will check each Ruby file against each RSpec file. You may want to complete each Ruby file one by one, and run `rspec` for each separately. You can do this by calling `rspec` for a specific file.  
- Nemo: `rspec spec/nemo_spec.rb`  
- Dory: `rspec spec/dory_spec.rb`
- Crush: `rspec spec/crush_spec.rb`
